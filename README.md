So, funny story. I finished my project early and decided to try to learn how to use Firebase with Angular 2. I started using a GitBook that was also focused on testing. Great, right? I like testing, so this would kill two birds, so on and so forth.

So I start, and it's a struggle. My code doesn't work, even though it matches theirs. Thankfully they put up a git repo so I could follow along (copy) with that. I get a test running, I think, and figure I can move on to the installing Firebase thing. I click the link to Chapter 3 and... there's no Chapter 3. There's no chapters after the testing chapters. So there goes an hour of my morning and *
