Hey Jake! I hope you get this! We talked it over today, and we think Ember will actually be more efficient for our project. We already know how to implement APIs, helpers, and services, and those will essentially get us most of the way to our MVP. Sorry if you've dedicated a lot of time to Angular over the weekend. See you tomorrow!
